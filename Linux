# üêß Linux

## Overview
Linux is an **open-source, Unix-like operating system** that powers the majority of cloud servers, container platforms, and CI/CD pipelines. Knowing Linux basics is essential for any DevOps engineer.

## Why Linux Matters in DevOps
- It's the OS for most servers, cloud VMs, and Docker containers.
- Tools like Jenkins, Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible, and Terraform all typically run on Linux.
- Shell scripting and command-line proficiency are crucial for automation and troubleshooting.
